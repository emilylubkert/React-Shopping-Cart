# React Shopping Cart

## Description
This is a simple shopping cart app that displays products from an initial array. Items can be added to the cart and the total of items added is kept track of in the "checkout" button. When items are added to the cart, the corresponding number of instock items decreases. Items can also be removed from the cart and added back to stock, increasing the instock number.

Products can be "restocked" by making a call to a custom Strapi API.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
- Adding logic so that duplicate products aren't added when restocking; rather, the instock number for existing products is updated
- Enhanced CSS styling
